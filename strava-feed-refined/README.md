[![Greasy Fork](https://img.shields.io/greasyfork/dt/560335?label=Strava%20-%20Hide%20Unwanted%20Feed%20Items)][GreasyFork]

## 🚀 Installation

See the [script page on Greasy Fork][GreasyFork].

## 🎯 What It Does

Strava’s feed can get noisy — challenge banners, virtual rides, daily commutes… that kind of clutter buries the moments that actually inspire you. Just see what the users are saying over at [Strava Community Hub](https://communityhub.strava.com/ideas/filter-the-type-of-activities-posts-content-that-shows-in-my-feed-6670). This script uses CSS to automatically hide unwanted content on the Strava feed and athlete pages.

No complicated settings. Just install and enjoy a better Strava experience. 🤩

### 🛠️ Specifically, It Hides

* All challenge progress banners (joined a challenge, hit 25% completion, etc.)
* Activities unless they are from a favorite (“starred”) athlete:
  * Commutes, unless they include photos
  * Virtual rides
  * Certain indoor or map-less activities (e.g., weight training)

✔ Everything hidden by the script is logged in your browser console for transparency.
