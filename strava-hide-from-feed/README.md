# Strava - Hide from Feed (Mute)

![Greasy Fork](https://img.shields.io/greasyfork/dt/473372?label=Strava%20-%20Hide%20from%20Feed%20(Mute))

## Installation

See the [script page on Greasy Fork][GreasyFork].

## Description

There is a feature gap between Strava's web and mobile apps. In particular, the former lacks the UI allowing to [mute a given activity](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415798243597-Mute-Activity). Please vote [at Strava Community Hub](https://communityhub.strava.com/t5/ideas/enable-muted-activities-on-web/idi-p/3805) for proper implementation of this in the web app.

In the meantime, this user script tries to fill that gap by adding mute option to activity edit page:
